## About

I'm a sophomore undergraduate in the JohnClass of 2023 at [Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Previously, I had the honor of being mentored by Prof. [Yong-Lu Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/) in the [RHOS](https://mvig-rhos.com/) Lab at SJTU. My research interests include, but are not limited to, multimodal learning, as well as AI safety and security.
