## About

I'm a junior undergraduate in the JohnClass at [Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am currently an undergraduate research intern, fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chaowei Xiao](https://xiaocw11.github.io/index.html) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://ai.jhu.edu//). Previously, I had the honor of being mentored by Prof. [Yong-Lu Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/) in the [RHOS](https://mvig-rhos.com/) Lab at SJTU. My research interests include, but are not limited to, multimodal learning, as well as AI safety and security.
