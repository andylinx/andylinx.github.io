title: "The Labyrinth of Links: Navigating the Associative Maze of Multi-modal LLMs"
collection: publications\
category: manuscripts
excerpt: "In this paper, we first devise a standard association benchmark based on adjective and verb association semantic concepts. Instead of costly data annotation and organization, we propose a convenient annotation-free reconstruction method transforming the general dataset for our association tasks. Furthermore, we comprehensively investigate the MLLMs's ability and potential for association ability.
